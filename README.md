# portfolio project 1 (Sliding Puzzle Game)

It is a small but fun Sliding Puzzle game. 🧩

If you do not like the picture you got, click on the “New Picture” button. To start the game, hit the “Start Game” button. To move a block, just drag one marked with dashed lines and drop it to the empty place. The goal is to move the blocks to form the original image. You can slide only one block at a time.

That’s all. Have fun! 🕹️

I base the idea of the game on a Traversy Media educational project.

For me, this was a great exercise about JavaScript’s drag-and-drop API spiced upon with a randomizing function.
